## Overview
1. motivation of this project:
   1. recently proposed nature-inspired algorithms are not such novel and not such mysterious.
   2. because they are repeating same concepts/ideas of some old typical algorithms.
   3. this problem will mislead the research community(e.g. Algorithm design is no longer concerned with whether it really proposes an effect algorithm, but only with whether there is a new name algorithm)
2. solution to the problem:
    1. the novelty/special parts of algorithms will be easier to be found, if these algorithms could be discussed in only one environment.
    2. this only one environment is such a place in which algorithms use same terminologies, 

3. experiments to prove the solution is correct:

4. conclusion:

5. shortcomings:
   
6. comparison with other relative papers:

6. future imagination:
